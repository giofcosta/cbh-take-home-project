// In my refactored version of the function, I focused on improving the readability of the code by breaking it down into smaller, more focused functions with clear names and single responsibilities. I also removed unnecessary nested if statements and made use of early returns 
// to reduce the level of indentation. Additionally, I made use of const and let keywords to clearly indicate the intention and scope of variables, and added comments to explain the purpose of certain code blocks. Overall, I believe these changes make the code easier to read and understand, 
// which can improve maintainability and reduce bugs in the future.
